  <h1>Agentic Inbox</h1>
  <p><em>A self-hosted email client with an AI agent, running entirely on Cloudflare Workers</em></p>
</div>

Agentic Inbox lets you send, receive, and manage emails through a modern web interface -- all powered by your own Cloudflare account. Incoming emails arrive via [Cloudflare Email Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/), each mailbox is isolated in its own [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) with a SQLite database, and attachments are stored in [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/).

An **AI-powered Email Agent** can read your inbox, search conversations, and draft replies -- built with the [Cloudflare Agents SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/) and [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/).

Read the blog post to learn more about Cloudflare Email Service and how to use it with the Agents SDK, MCP, and from the Wrangler CLI: [Email for Agents](https://blog.cloudflare.com/email-for-agents/).

## How to setup

**Important**: Clicking the 'Deploy to Cloudflare' button is only one part of the setup. You must follow the **After deploying** steps as well. For a full step-by-step guide with screenshots, refer to this comment: 
https://github.com/cloudflare/agentic-inbox/issues/4#issuecomment-4269118513

### To set up

1. Deploy to Cloudflare. The deploy flow will automatically provision R2, Durable Objects, and Workers AI. You'll be prompted for **DOMAINS**, which is the domain (yourdomain.com) you want to receive emails for (email@yourdomain.com).

     [![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/agentic-inbox)

2. **Configure auth** -- Set the `SESSION_SECRET` secret (`wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET`) to a strong random string (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Set `ADMIN_EMAILS` to your own email so you automatically own all existing mailboxes, and optionally set `MCP_TOKEN` if you want the `/mcp` endpoint enabled. See `.dev.vars.example`.
3. **Set up Email Routing** -- In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to your domain > Email Routing and create a catch-all rule that forwards to this Worker
4. **Enable Email Service** -- The worker needs the `send_email` binding to send outbound emails. See [Email Service docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/email-workers/send-email-workers/)
5. **Create a mailbox** -- Visit your deployed app and create a mailbox for any address on your domain (e.g. `hello@example.com`)

### Troubleshooting Auth

1. If you see `Invalid email or password`, the credentials are wrong or the user doesn't exist. Registration is enabled by default (`ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true`); disable it once your accounts are created.
2. If you get `403 Forbidden: you do not have access to this mailbox`, your user isn't granted that mailbox. Mailboxes created before auth was introduced need an admin grant — set `ADMIN_EMAILS` to your email and log in again to auto-claim all existing mailboxes.
3. The `/mcp` endpoint returns `503` unless `MCP_TOKEN` is configured. This is intentional (fail closed).

## Features

- **Full email client** — Send and receive emails via Cloudflare Email Routing with a rich text composer, reply/forward threading, folder organization, search, and attachments
- **Per-mailbox isolation** — Each mailbox runs in its own Durable Object with SQLite storage and R2 for attachments
- **Built-in AI agent** — Side panel with 9 email tools for reading, searching, drafting, and sending
- **Auto-draft on new email** — Agent automatically reads inbound emails and generates draft replies, always requiring explicit confirmation before sending
- **Configurable and persistent** — Custom system prompts per mailbox, persistent chat history, streaming markdown responses, and tool call visibility

## Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, React Router v7, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, TipTap, `@cloudflare/kumo`
- **Backend:** Hono, Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects (SQLite), R2, Email Routing
- **AI Agent:** Cloudflare Agents SDK (`AIChatAgent`), AI SDK v6, Workers AI (`@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`), `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm`
- **Auth:** Built-in email + password accounts (PBKDF2-SHA256 via WebCrypto) with HttpOnly session cookies. Replaces Cloudflare Access as the trust boundary.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Configuration

1. Set your domain in `wrangler.jsonc`
2. Create an R2 bucket named `agentic-inbox`: `wrangler r2 bucket create agentic-inbox`
3. Set the auth secret and admin emails (see `.dev.vars.example`):
   - `wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET` (required, `openssl rand -hex 32`)
   - `wrangler secret put MCP_TOKEN` (optional, enables `/mcp`)
   - `wrangler secret put ADMIN_EMAILS` (optional, e.g. `you@example.com` — auto-claims all mailboxes)
   - `wrangler secret put ALLOW_REGISTRATION` (optional, `false` after your account exists)

### Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account with a domain
- [Email Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/) enabled for receiving
- [Email Service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/) enabled for sending
- [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) enabled (for the agent)

Access is controlled per-account with email + password login. Users only see mailboxes they own (or that were granted to them). The MCP server at `/mcp` is additionally protected by a shared bearer token (`MCP_TOKEN`) and is disabled unless that token is set.
